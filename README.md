## Description 
- This project implements a Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) authentication system using Python. 
It generates secrets, creates QR codes for authentication apps, and verifies user codes.
## Features 
- Generate secure TOTP secrets
- Create QR codes for easy authentication setup
- Verify one-time passwords entered by the user

## Installation

```bash
pip install pyotp qrcode
```

## Usage
Follow the prompts to:
1. Generate and save a secret key.
2. Scan the QR code with an authenticator app.
3. Enter the generated code to verify authentication.

## Run
Run the script using:

```bash
python main.py
```
## File Structure
- `main.py` - The primary script for generating secrets, QR codes, and verifying authentication.
- `secrets.txt` - Stores generated secrets (for demonstration only; should use a secure storage method).
- `backup_codes.txt` - File for storing backup codes in case of authentication failure.
